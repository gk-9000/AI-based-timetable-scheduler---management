# AI-Powered Timetable Scheduler and Management

> **Abstract**: This project aims to develop an AI-powered application that generates timetables based on constraints specified by teachers for lectures and laboratory work. The application utilizes a combination of Random Forest and Genetic Algorithm for optimized scheduling, ensuring efficient management of resources and minimizing scheduling conflicts.
